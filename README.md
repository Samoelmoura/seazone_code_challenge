# 1.0 Business Problem
## 1.1 Data description
Seazone is a Proptech focused on the Short-Stay Vacation Homes market. This market is
composed by players such as Guests, Hosts, Real Estate Investors, Constructors and Home
Service Providers and we offer the following products and services:
- Property management
- Real Estate Project Development
- Online Travel Agency (reservation marketplace)
- Professional Hosting
As a data-driven company we need to have reliable data and analysis in order to make
strategic decisions. In order to do this we built an ETL pipeline based on two main data
sources: Airbnb and VivaReal. To feed the pipeline we designed a group of scrapers that
acquire the data available online from these websites daily and drop it inside of a data lake.
For this challenge we will provide 5 data sets to evaluate your skills in data wrangling,
enriching, modeling and also on machine learning.

## 1.2 Data analysis
Itapema is a strategic city for Seazone and we would like to know, based on the data,
if we should focus on it or not. In order to make our decision we would like you to tell us the
following:
- What is the best property profile to invest in the city?
- Which is the best location in the city in terms of revenue?
- What are the characteristics and reasons for the best revenues in the city?
- We would like to build a building of 50 apartments in the city, where should we build it
and how should the apartments be designed in order to be a great investment?
- How much will be the return on investment of this building in the years 2024, 2025
and 2026?
